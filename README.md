# TDT4100 Project

## About TDT4100

TDT4100 is a subject teaching object oriented programming. Its intention is teaching general concepts in object orientation, and used Java as the concrete language in which programming exercises are done.

## The project

A mandatory part of the subject is completing a project with UI made in JavaFX. We (the students) were given 3-4 weeks to complete the project.

## This repository

My project ended up being a collection of several parts:
- A simple IDE
- A compiler for my own programming language
- A debugger
- A virtual machine to run code generated by the compiler
